## Little summary
Hey! 
This repository corresponds to my first virtual internship as a data scientist for British Airways. This project aims to better understand customers and their experience with the airline. For this, a collection of user reviews was done by web scraping and then a sentiment analysis of these reviews. 

## Status of the project
The status of the project is finalized! Here you will find some that summarize the analysis very well! 
 
## Dataset and libraries used
This model was made on a jupyter notebook, and I used the following libraries: Request, NLTK, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, RegEx and VADER. The dataset used was collected by scraping and stored in 'BA_reviews.csv'.

## Steps
Steps:
1. Scrape the 3564 British Airways reviews avaible on the AirQuality website [link](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways).

2. Cleaning of the data, leaving the text column of the reviews ready for analysis.

3. Sentiment analysis using VADER polarity scores, where the sentiment compound is composed of the sum of negative, neutral and positive sentiment. 

4. Data viz: Plotting the key data! 

## Results!
